## 📖 Overview

**Codex Account Switcher** is an ultra-lightweight, blazing-fast macOS menu bar utility built in pure Swift. It eliminates the friction of managing multiple OpenAI Codex / ChatGPT credentials on your local machine. 

With zero external dependencies and a footprint under 300KB, it integrates directly with standard macOS system APIs to hot-swap account tokens, safely restart active desktop applications, and feed real-time usage budgets directly into your status bar.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎛️ One-Click Switch & Hot Reload
*   Instantly swap between saved profiles in less than a second.
*   Automatically terminates, purges, and restarts active desktop Codex app processes in the background to apply the new active session instantly.

### 🌀 High-Tech Braille Loader Animation
*   Upgraded with a modern, ultra-smooth spinning loader (`⠋`, `⠙`, `⠹`, `⠸`, `⠼`, `⠴`...) rotating at `0.08s` intervals in your menu bar. 
*   Provides immediate, state-of-the-art interactive feedback during backend swapping operations.

### 📊 Real-Time Usage & Cap Meters
*   Track remaining account limits (5-Hour and Weekly) directly in your status bar or inside the dropdown column.
*   Timers are registered in the `.common` run loop mode, ensuring background checks keep updating even when you are interacting with the menu!

### 🔔 Low-Usage Notifications
*   Get a macOS notification when the active account drops below your chosen usage threshold.
*   Use **Usage Reminder → Set Reminder Percentage...** to change the default 10% threshold.
*   If alerts are blocked, **Test Notification** opens System Settings so you can enable notifications for Codex Account Switcher.

### 🗺️ Dynamic Environment Resolution
*   **Zero Hardcoding**: Dynamically parses and traverses your local NVM (`~/.nvm`) Node installations to locate the executable binary.
*   **Intelligent Shell Fallback**: Falls back to zsh login streams (`/bin/zsh -l`) to query environment maps if customized `PATH` parameters are missing.

### 🏷️ Custom Account Labeling
*   Add custom aliases, numbers, or emojis (e.g. `01`, `Work`, `🚀`) to identify accounts instantly in the status line while preserving emails in standard dropdown grids.

### 🎨 Separate App & Menu Bar Icons
*   `Sources/icon.png` is packaged as the application icon.
*   `Sources/toolbar-icon.png` is bundled separately for the menu bar status item.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Swift menu bar orchestrates token swapping and app lifecycle management securely via local POSIX subprocess bindings:

```
[ macOS Menu Bar ]
       │
       ├─► [1] Swaps active credentials safely in registry.json & auth.json
       ├─► [2] Triggers background process termination signals (SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
       ├─► [3] Relaunches desktop app via CLI fallback (`open -a Codex`)
       └─► [4] Starts smooth Braille spinner on Main Thread (.common Run Loop)
```

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamedFuad16/Codex-Acc-Switcher.git
cd Codex-Acc-Switcher
```

### 2. Build the Application Bundle
We have provided standard executables to compile and assemble the App Bundle seamlessly. Run:
```bash
./build.sh
```
This builds and places `Codex Account Switcher.app` in the `./build` directory.

### 3. Deploy to Applications
To copy the application safely to your local Applications folder (`~/Applications`):
```bash
./install.sh
```

### 4. Enable Notifications
Open the menu bar item and choose **Usage Reminder → Test Notification**. If macOS blocks alerts, choose **Open Settings** and allow notifications for **Codex Account Switcher**.

## 🛠️ Development

This utility is built completely in Swift with **zero external package dependencies** (no CocoaPods, no Swift Package Manager dependencies, no dynamic frameworks), compiled directly with `swiftc`. This results in an incredibly responsive, native application with a negligible memory footprint.

*   **Language**: Swift 5.9+
*   **APIs**: Cocoa / AppKit (`NSStatusBar`, `NSStatusItem`, `NSMenu`, `Process`, `Pipe`)
*   **Compiler**: `swiftc` targeted for macOS 14.0+ (`arm64-apple-macosx14.0`)

To test changes rapidly without installing:
```bash
./run.sh
```

## 🔀 What this fork changes

This fork is maintained at [admiraldata/codex-acc-switcher](https://github.com/admiraldata/codex-acc-switcher).
It tracks the original by [@MohamedFuad16](https://github.com/MohamedFuad16) and adds:

*   **`codex-auth` 0.2.x compatibility** — switches and removes accounts by **email** (the `switch`/`remove <query>` form that 0.2.x accepts) instead of the row-number selector, which is not recognized in that version.
*   **Conditional Codex App relaunch** — the Codex App is only force-restarted on switch if it was already running, so CLI-only users are not interrupted by an unwanted launch.
*   **Live usage refresh** — a cached `list --skip-api` poll keeps the menu responsive, while a live `list --api` refresh on launch, every 15 minutes, and on manual **Refresh** keeps 5h/weekly usage and resets current.
*   **Inline weekly remaining** — each account row shows its remaining weekly percentage directly in the menu.

All upstream functionality and design are unchanged; these are additive fixes.
